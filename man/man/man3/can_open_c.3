.PP
int open(const char *pathname, int flags); opens the CAN device for following operations.
.PP
\fBParameters: \fR
.in +1c

\fB\fIpathname\fR\fR
device pathname, usual /dev/can? 
.TP
\fB\fIflags\fR\fR

.PP
The open call is used to "open" the device. Doing a first initialization according the to values in the /proc/sys/Can file system. Additional an ISR function is assigned to the IRQ.
.PP
The CLK OUT pin is configured for creating the same frequency like the chips input frequency fclk (XTAL).
.PP

.TP
 \fCENXIO\fR the file is a device special file and no corresponding device exists. 
.TP
 \fCEINVAL\fR illegal \fBminor\fR device number 
.TP
