Setup IO-ports and IRQ of DIL-Net-PC1486 and
DIL-Net-PC1520!

This Software uses clig (http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/clighome)
as Commandline Parser.

clig does not need to be installed if you do not intend to change the
commandline Options, as the generated cmdline.c and cmdline.h Sources are
available in this directory.

SJA1000-custom.pdf shows a Schematic for connecting an SJA-1000 chip
directly to a DIL-NET-PC.

This Setup-Tool also supports this schematic! Just set the CAN-Driver to
trm816 Mode.
