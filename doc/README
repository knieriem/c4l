Memory mapped I/O
===================================================
If a CAN Board uses memory mapped I/O on ISA,
be sure that the in the PC BIOS access to that memory area is enabled.
You can for example use Alessandro Rubini's
silly device driver to read out the ISA IO memory area to scan for
a SJA100.

$ cat /dev/sillyb | od --address-radix=x -t x1| less

after an hardware reset (power on)
you should find the following pattern:

038000 21 ff 0c e0 00 00 00 00 00 60 ff ff ff ff ff ff
038010 ff ff ff ff fd fb df ff 0b 00 08 31 ff ff ff 00

(Adress is starting with 0 == 0x0a0000)
The example above shows the result with a STZP/IXXAT PCI-03 board
jumpered for 0xd800 with an sja1000 as CAN0.
Especially "0c 0e" is the reset value for registers 2(status)
and 3(interrupt).

use 
$ cat /dev/sillyb \
| od --address-radix=x --skip-bytes 0x38000 --read-bytes=0x20 -t x1| less

to see oly the 32 bytes at address 0xd8000.
