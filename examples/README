This are some simple examples to test the communication between two
CAN boards.

1) receive: polling mode receiving end
2) transmit polling mode transmitter

3) baud
    simple driver test: change the bit rate registers with ioctl()
    the change itself stays after program is finished.
    you can check it by read
    cat /proc/sys/Can/Baud
    before and after using this command

4) acceptance
    simple driver test: change the message filter with ioctl()
    the change itself stays after program is finished.
    you can check it by read
    cat /proc/sys/Can/AccCode /proc/sys/Can/AccMask
    before and after using this command

5) noiser
    a simple noise transmitter, generates messages with random
    CAN IDs and telegram content
    useful for filter testing 

6) can_send
    simple command line tool for sending single or
    cyclic CAN messages
    can_send -h   tells you all
    some special test-sequences are build-in

7) ctest
    very simple and basic driver test
    I use it to see what the driver issues in /var/log/messages
    when open and close the device
    if full debug is enabled and all register access is logged
