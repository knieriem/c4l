is derived from the LLP projects can4linux driver

the most of the ddl stuff is removed
as is the support for supporting different chip-sets and i/o models.
some useful macros are anyway used in this version
like the Debug functions ( DBGin();DBGout();)
or function parameters which do differ in different Linux kernel versions.
Since version 2.3 ther is a new debug macro called 
DEBUG_TTY(level, "some printf text");
This macro, if level is > dbgMask, print some text onto the console
of the application program (not via syslog to /var/log/messages ).

the IO Model - is compiled in (that means it must be selected at compile time)

CAN Chip functions
are coded in the files can_<CHIP>funcs.c, e.g. can_82c200func.c
Basic hardware access functions are in can_82c200funcs.c

all I/O depencies are in the Macros
    CANout(bd,adr,v)
    CANin(bd,adr)
    CANset(bd,adr,m)
    CANreset(bd,adr,m)
    CANtest(bd,adr,m)
defined in can_defs.h
